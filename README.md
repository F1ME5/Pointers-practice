# Pointers-practice
C++ program where I practiced pointers theory (OOP included).

First I wanna emphasize that these cases are not the same:
	a) Array of pointers to pointers.
		int** ptr[10]; ///EXAMPLE
	b) Pointer to an array of pointers.
		int** ptr = new int*[10]; ///EXAMPLE
      
"a" is a structured data type / "b" is a primitive data type. That's why the memory usage is different in both cases.
